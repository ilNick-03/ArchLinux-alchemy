#### *[mpv-webaudio.sh](./scripts/audio/dl-tools/mpv-webaudio.sh)*
A streamlined solution for seizing and catching web audio streams real-time web audio, directly via terminal, without the weight of a browser or local storage.

- **Features:**
  - **Zero-Footprint Streaming:** Pipes the raw audio data from `yt-dlp` directly into `mpv`, bypassing the need to create temporary files;
  - **Optimized Buffering:** Pre-configured with specific cache and demuxer limits to ensure stable playback even on fluctuating connections;
  - **Headless Operation:** Forces a no-video, no-display mode to minimize CPU and RAM usage, focusing purely on the auditory experience.

##### Dependencies (Ingredients)
To achieve seamless real-time streaming, ensure these elements are active:
- [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) - The extraction engine;
- [mpv](https://mpv.io/) - The high-performance media renderer used for output.

##### Shell Integration
Add this alias to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:

```bash
alias mpv-webaudio='~/scripts/audio/dl-tools/mpv-webaudio.sh'
```


#### *[ytdl-bestaudio.sh](./scripts/audio/dl-tools/ytdl-bestaudio.sh)*
A sophisticated wrapper for `yt-dlp` designed to isolate, extract, and verify the highest quality audio streams available.

- **Features:**
    - **Smart Codec-Sensing:** Uses `ffprobe` to analyze the internal stream and assign the mathematically correct extension (e.g., `.opus`, `.aac`) rather than a generic container name;
    - **Path Sanitization:** Automatically transmutes illegal characters (like `/`) in web titles into shell-safe symbols to prevent directory errors;
    - **Best-quality Priority:** Ensures the best lossy compression ratio available;
    - **Atomic Operations:** Uses PID-based temporary files to allow multiple concurrent extractions without data collision.

##### Dependencies (Ingredients)
To correctly retrieve and verify audio streams, the following "ingredients" must be present:
- [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) - The core engine for media extraction. Always keep it updated (`yt-dlp --update`);
- [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) - Specifically `ffmpeg` for extraction and `ffprobe` for stream analysis;
- [bun](https://bun.sh/) or [deno](https://deno.com/) (Optional but strongly recommended) - High-performance JS runtimes to solve provider challenges and avoid `HTTP 403` errors;
- [coreutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/) - Provides `shuf` and `sed` for title sanitization and randomization.

##### Shell Integration
Add this alias to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` for instant access:

```bash
alias ytdl-bestaudio='~/scripts/audio/dl-tools/ytdl-bestaudio.sh'
```


### 💡 Expert Lessons & Troubleshooting (Bonus)
To ensure a successful fetching of web streams, follow these principles:

1.  **Keep the Engine Sharp** - Platforms like *YouTube* update their defenses daily. If a download fails, ensure your engine is up to date: `yt-dlp -update`;
2.  **The "Warm-up" Technique** - For videos protected by modern challenges (PO-Tokens), open the URL in your browser (e.g., *[LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net/)*) and let the media play for a few seconds. This "warms up" your IP and session, clearing the path for the script;
3.  **Quote the URL** - Always wrap the web link in double quotes when launching the script to prevent the shell from misinterpreting special characters like `&` or `?`.
    Example:  `ytdl-bestaudio "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=..."`
4.  **The "*IP*-Flagging" Reality** – Intense use of these tools may trigger **HTTP 4xx errors** (typically 403 or 429). This happens when the provider's server flags your IP address for unusual traffic. To dissolve this block:
    - **The "Warm-up" Technique**: Open the URL in your browser (e.g., *[LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net/)*) and play the media for a few seconds. This validates your session;
    - **Authentication**: Consider passing cookies from your browser to the script (e.g., using `--cookies-from-browser`);
    - **Metamorphosis**: Change your digital signature by toggling a ***VPN*** or reconnecting your router to obtain a fresh *IP*;
    - **Patience**: Sometimes, the best remedy is simply to wait a few hours for the "heat" on your *IP* to dissipate.

---

### *[alacritty](./dotfiles/.config/alacritty/alacritty.toml)*
This terminal configuration for [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) designed to act as the "scrying glass" for the system's inner workings, and handle multiple panes inside the terminal window.

- **Features:**
    - **Aesthetic Transparency:** Pre-configured with 30% opacity and compositor-ready blur for a seamless desktop blend;
    - **Native Multi-Pane Support:** Engineered to automatically spawn or attach to a `tmux` session, enabling advanced split-view layouts and multi-panel orchestration within a single window;
    - **Persistence Engine:** Your workspace survives terminal closures; re-opening Alacritty instantly restores your active "alchemy" session;
    - **Multi-State Palettes:** Includes 3 curated alchemical color schemes (Carbon Gray, Obsidian, Deep Black) to minimize eye-strain.
