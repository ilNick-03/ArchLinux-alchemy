# ArchLinux-alchemy
A personal vault of (*Arch*) *Linux* scripts and ricing procedures, exploring the hidden, magic potential behind your *OS* and transmuting it into a refined digital experience.

## 🧪 Easy and powerful Scripts

See the [dedicated README (manifest) for 'scripts' subfolder](./scripts/SCRIPTS_README.md) for more informations.

## 🏺 Essence & Configurations (Dotfiles)
A collection of primordial configurations and dotfiles that define the behavior, aesthetics, and interaction logic of the digital environment.

See the [dedicated README (manifest) for 'dotfiles' subfolder](./dotfiles/DOTFILES_README.md) for more informations.

## 🛠️ Arch fixes
> *Section under construction.*

This area will soon include a collection of specific remedies and configurations to address common (*Arch*) *Linux* issues and system behaviors.

> [!NOTE]
> While these fixes are essential for an optimized *Arch Linux* experience on mobile hardware (like the *HP Victus* series), the logic is **distro-agnostic**. They will function on any *Linux* distribution that utilizes the standard `/sys/class/` kernel interface.
